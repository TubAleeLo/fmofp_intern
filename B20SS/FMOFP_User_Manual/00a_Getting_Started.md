[DISPLAY] Initializing display management system...
[FMS] Initializing flight management system...
[SYSTEM] All systems operational - Ready for operations
```

**Step 3: Verify System Health**
- [ ] **No Critical Errors:** Check that no ERROR messages appear during startup
- [ ] **Radar Systems:** All radar systems should show STANDBY mode
- [ ] **Display Systems:** PFD should display flight parameters

   - Access Weather Radar controls
   - Change from STANDBY to SURVEILLANCE mode
   - Monitor logs for successful mode change
   - Verify data generation begins

2. **Test Display Responsiveness:**
   - Open Primary Flight Display (PFD)
   - Verify real-time flight data updates
   - Check attitude indicator movement
   - Confirm tactical indicators are active

3. **Test System Integration:**
   - Monitor FMS data flow to displays
   - Verify 1553B message traffic
   - Check system health indicators
   - Confirm no communication errors

## Understanding Current System Limitations

### Known Issues for Interns

**Weather Radar Display Integration 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES:**
- Weather radar processing works correctly
- VIL and precipitation data generation is operational
- **Issue:** 1553B communication prevents data from reaching displays
- **What You'll See:** Mode changes work, but no weather data on displays
- **Monitoring:** Use system logs to verify radar is processing data

**Other Radar Systems ⚠️ IN DEVELOPMENT:**
- All radar systems (Targeting, SAR, TFR, AEWC) process data correctly
- **Issue:** Display integration not yet implemented
- **What You'll See:** Mode changes work, data processing occurs
- **Monitoring:** Check logs for data generation confirmation

**Display System Integration:**
- Display rendering works perfectly
- Flight Management System data integration is operational
- **Limitation:** Only FMS data appears on displays, not radar data
- **What You'll See:** PFD shows flight data, MFD shows system status

### Working Around Limitations

**For Radar Testing:**
1. Use system logs to verify radar operations
2. Monitor mode change confirmations
3. Check data generation messages
4. Verify system health indicators

**For Display Testing:**
1. Focus on FMS data integration
2. Test theme changes and visual effects
3. Verify display responsiveness
4. Check tactical indicators (G-force, AOA)

**For System Integration:**
1. Monitor 1553B communication status
2. Verify message routing (even if data doesn't display)
3. Test system startup and shutdown procedures
4. Check database operations

### Common Questions for Interns

**Q: Why don't I see radar data on displays?**
A: This is a known issue with 1553B communication. The radar systems are working correctly, but data isn't reaching the displays. Monitor the logs to verify radar operation.

**Q: How do I know if a mode change worked?**
A: Check the mode indicator in the interface and monitor the log output for confirmation messages. You should see processing begin even if data doesn't display.

**Q: What should I do if the system won't start?**
A: Check Python and PyQt6 installation, verify file permissions, and review the startup logs for specific error messages.
